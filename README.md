Leaf Android Pedometer
=========

Lightweight pedometer app using the <b>hardware step-sensor</b> for minimal battery consumption.
This app is designed to be kept running all the time without having any impact on your battery life! It uses the hardware step detection sensor of the Nexus 5, which is already running even when not using any pedometer app. Therefore the app does not drain any additional battery. Unlike other pedometer apps, this app does <b>not</b> track your movement or your location so it doesn't need to turn on your GPS sensor (again: <b>no impact on your battery</b>).


Leaf Pedometer is based on https://github.com/FREDRICK-GITHUB/Pedometer by Fredrick Maina.    

Pedometer uses the [EazeGraphLibrary](https://github.com/blackfizz/EazeGraph "EazeGraphLibrary") by Paul Cech and [a fork](https://github.com/j4velin/colorpicker) of [ColorPickerPreference](https://github.com/attenzione/android-ColorPickerPreference "android-ColorPickerPreference: Android color picking library") by Sergey Margaritov.
